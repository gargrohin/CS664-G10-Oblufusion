# Dual Mounted Inertial Navigation Sensor

Our course project for CS664 IoT system design. The Project-Report.pdf gives most of the details

## Code

All the code that needs to be run is in the Start Code folder. "left-oblu.py" and "right-oblu.py" control the 2 different oblu mounted on respective feet.

The code in "oblu-fusion.py" implements the fusion algorithm, and gives the corrected data.

### Data

Corrected X and Y coordinates are logged in the 'lfinalc.txt' and 'rfinalc.txt' files.

### Plots

In order to view the plots in real time, you must run the code in Plots/plot.py.

### Performance graphs

Some of the plots showing corrected and original data. Red shows Original data, and Blue shows corrected data. 
Two different plots for left and right feet.
